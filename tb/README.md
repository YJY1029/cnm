# Testbenches
## CoNM_soc_tb
The most useful one. By rewriting file name in the first "`include CASE" line, the test engineer can easily test any instruction they want. 
I could have implemented a programme to run it by using makefiles under linux environment, if I had a better higher high-level language programming skill. As of now, please just waste some time on rewriting test case names. XD
## tb
Used for single-instruction test. But it doesn't support any form of jumping operations if no conditional statements is added.
